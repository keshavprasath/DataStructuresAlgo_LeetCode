# Data Strcuture & Algorithms

Here i document my journey through Leetcode specifically (also using Neetcode).

I try a step by step method, from laying down the potential psuedocode, to actually building the functions. 
I make it a practise to also talk about operation and time complexity of my algorthm to further understand the code. 
Additoanlly, i try to go back older problems and optimse them to reduce time complixity or improve code efficiency by using better data structures or newer algorithms learnt.

(Note: the code is all done by me without the help of AI)
