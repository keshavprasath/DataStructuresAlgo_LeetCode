# Data Structures & Algorithms
This repository documents my journey of learning and practicing data structures and algorithms in Python, focusing primarily on problems from LeetCode and NeetCode.

## Approach
My approach involves the following steps:

- Write down the potential pseudocode for the problem.
- Implement the functions based on the pseudocode.
- Analyze and discuss the time and space complexity of the implemented algorithm to deepen my understanding of the code.
- Periodically revisit older problems to optimize them by reducing time complexity, improving code efficiency, or applying new data structures and algorithms learned.

(Note: All code in this repository is written by me without the assistance of AI. This was purely done to develop algorithmic thinking than rushing for solutions)
